	<h1>The Fresh Prince <br/>of Bel-Air</h1>
	
	<p>From western Philadelphia I hail
	where in my youth I'd play upon the green
	'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
	by ruffians contemptible and mean.</p><br/>

	<p>Although the spat was trivial and brief,
	it wounded my dear mother deep within;
	and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
	she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.</p><br/>
	
	<p>When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
	I came upon a coachman most unique;
	and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
	despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
	I survey all the land with princely mien
	in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
